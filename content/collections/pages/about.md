The existing market is dominated by the traditional banking sector utilising outdated technologies and focused on traditional payment methods. 

Payment transaction volume growth owing to:
- Shift to online
- Reduction in cheque usage
- Reduction in cash usage
- Increase in Faster Payments
- Compound Annual Growth Rate of 4% in transactions

Despite this, in the market, there is a lack of competition as only two new Clearing Banks in 250 years have been established and consolidation has reduced choice. Furthermore, legacy processing systems are unable to cope with new regulations, risk and payment methods, and, costs in the existing system are too high and restrict utilisation (first reported by Cruickshank in 2000).

Consequently, there is a need for a new data-driven clearing bank in the market that will deliver high availability, multiple payment methods and different forms of transactions to the market in a low-risk, regulated and dynamic environment.
