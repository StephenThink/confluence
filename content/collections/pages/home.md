  By designing a banking platform in the cloud, confluence will be able to offer existing banks (or new challenger banks), a working current account for their customers which, on a daily basis, analyses the income and expenditure through each account.​

  With the account holder’s permission, confluence’s software will make useful, cost-saving and life-enhancing suggestions including but not limited to analysis of mortgage and loan affordability driving product sales to account holders.
